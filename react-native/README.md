# React-Native

Official Jumio Mobile-SDK plugin for react-native.

## Requirements
* Jumio Mobile SDK Android 2.6.0+, iOS 2.5.0+

## Setup

### Setup iOS

1. Add the Jumio Mobile SDK to your iOS-project of your react-native project. If you don't want to add the sdk manually, you can use CocoaPods.
2. Download the plugin (JumioModuleIOS.h, JumioModuleIOS.m)
3. Open the workspace of the iOS-application and add the downloaded JumioModuleIOS-files to the project.
4. Add the "NSCameraUsageDescription"-key to your Info.plist file.
5. If needed: Customise your configuration.

Now the native part is done and we head over to the react native code.
